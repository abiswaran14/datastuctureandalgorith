q2="Which is not a feature of OOP in general definitions?"
print(q2)
print("--------------------")
print("1) Efficient Code","2)Code reusability  ","3) Modularity","4) Duplicate/Redundant data")


a1=int(input("answer:"))

if (a1==4 ):
    print("correct answer")
elif(a1>=4):
    print("enter correct answer,no answer not found")

else:
    print("the correct answer is 4,Explanation: Duplicate/Redundant data is dependent on programmer and hence canâ€™t be guaranteed by OOP. Code reusability is done using inheritance. Modularity is supported by using different code files and classes. Codes are more efficient because of features of OOP.")
